update data structure to support the new setup
add functionality for modals
add functionality for theorem addition
change input to textarea
add modal to shut off theorems (down the road)
make sure the functions all insert correctly

change the save session to a button which opens to a new page with the link and some text about the link on it.
make the link an anchor so that the user can confirm that it works.



OF THE BUTTONS, ONLY SOME NEED TO GO TO THE SERVER:

CALCULATE: DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO GO TO THE SERVER, CLIENT-SIDE JS SHOULD BE FINE
ADD INVARIANT: DOES NOT NEED TO GO TO THE SERVER
SAVE WORK: MAY OR MAY NOT, DEPENDING ON CLIENT-SIDE ACCESS TO DB, MAYBE ADD PHP STUFF?
ADD THEOREM: DOES NOT NEED TO GO TO THE SERVER

can only avoid the server if we can transfer data when necessary. If the data will freely go from one place to another
then we are fine. How to move data around... maybe with cookies, but not likely.
